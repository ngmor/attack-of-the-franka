### Brief Description of Project:
Our project is to have a robot use a lightsaber to help the Rebellion fight the Empire, where the setup of the workspace is configured by a human. The robot holds the lightsaber in its grippers to knock over members of the Imperial Army, represented by red blocks placed upright on a table near the Franka. Franakin Skywalker will need to avoid blocks representing members of the Rebellion, marked by upright blue blocks, using computer vision to differentiate the blocks.

### Summary of Project Capabilities (Goals Achieved): 
 - Robot recognizes which block it must knock over, picks up its lightsaber, and knocks over the “enemy” blocks without colliding into its “ally” blocks on the attack swing
 - The robot can pick up the lightsaber from a fixture on the side of the table
 - The robot is able to avoid multiple allies and knock over multiple enemies.
 - The robot calculates whether knocking an enemy over will cause the falling block to collide with an ally, and therefore does not swing in that style (i.e. prioritize leaving allies standing over knocking over enemies).
 - Robot will check all its swing/attack styles before giving up on the attack

### High Level Workflow:
Upon launching the attack of the franka launch file, the camera and robot nodes will start running. An rviz simulation of the franka with the walls and ceiling will appear as well as an rviz visualization of the transformations generated by the vision processing. Calling the /pickup_lightsaber service will command the robot to pick up the lightsaber from its sheath and the /look_for_enemies service will set the robot up to begin planning attacks on the red blocks. The state machine will evaluate three attack types, left swing, right swing, and stab, to ensure it doesn’t knock any blue blocks. If it is unable to attack an enemy, it will move on to the next one, until it is done with all enemies that are reachable.

### A discussion of the overall system architecture and high level concepts:

### Any other information, as appropriate (lessons learned, future work):
#### Lessons Learned:

#### Future Work:
Future work we would like to incorporate would be to have more robust movements that could take the distance from an ally to adjust its swing waypoints. We would also like to adjust our gripper to be able to turn the lightsaber on when it picks it up. 

### Setup Instructions:
To clone all necessary repositories, clone this repository into the `src` directory in your workspace root. Then from the workspace root directory, run the command:

`vcs import . < src/attack-of-the-franka/project.repos`

(This assumes you don't change the name of the repository, update the path accordingly if you do.)

If you don't have `vcstool` installed, install it with:

`sudo apt install python3-vcstool`

### Quickstart Guide of Useful Commands:
#### Running Full Workflow:
`ros2 launch attack_of_the_franka attack_of_the_franka.launch.py`
    
#### Run Only Camera Functionality:
`ros2 launch attack_of_the_franka realsense.launch.py`

#### Run Only Robot Movement Related Programs:
`ros2 launch attack_of_the_franka robot.launch.py`

#### To Pick Up the Lightsaber from the Sheath:
`ros2 service call /pickup_lightsaber std_srvs/srv/Empty`

#### To Start Attacking Enemies
`ros2 service call /look_for_enemies std_srvs/srv/Empty`

### List of all nodes and launchfiles and what they do:
#### Package Name: attack_of_the_franka
Type: ament_python
#### Nodes:
- camera_processor.py
    - Performs image processing for ally and enemy detection based on color.
    - Gets workspace area transforms and the robot transform
- common.py
    - A common library for functions/values used by all nodes
- robot_control.py
    - Runs the state machine related to motion and interacts with our moveit_interface API to plan and attack enemies. It processes camera information to locate allies and enemies and provides helpful services to do a variety of tasks with the lightsaber and blocks interaction. 
    simple_move
    - Controls robot and planning scene using the moveit_interface API.
#### Launchfiles:
- realsense.launch.py 
    - Launches the nodes needed to read in information from the RealSense camera and april tags to recognize the table and block locations relative to the robot base
- robot.launch.py 
    - Launches the robot_control node and other programs to view the rviz simulation of the franka robot
- attach_of_the_franka.launch.py       
    - combines the above two launch files to set up all the nodes needed to run the services and nodes needed to attack enemies
    moveit_testing.launch.py
- Launches the moveit launch file as well as out testing node named simple_move

### Helpful Services:

 - gripper_grasp (std_srvs.srv.Empty): moves the robot's end-effector together until               it's grasping an object between them
 - waypoints (std_srvs.srv.Empty): commands the robot to move to a predetermined waypoint
 - test_joint_trajectory (std_srvs.srv.Empty): commands robot to a predetermined waypoint using the joint angles
 - move_to_pose (moveit_testing_interfaces/srv/MoveToPose): move robot to specific position and orientation
 - joint_waypoint (std_srvs.srv.Empty)
 - move_to_position (moveit_testing_interfaces/srv/MoveToPosition): move robot to specific position
 - move_to_orientation (moveit_testing_interfaces/srv/MoveToOrientation): move robot to specific orientation
 - update_obstacles (moveit_testing_interfaces/srv/UpdateObstacles): add obstacles to scene
 - pickup_lightsaber (std_srvs.srv.Empty): commands the robot to follow waypoints to pick up pick up the fixed lightsaber with the end-effector
 - update_persistent_obstacles (moveit_testing_interfaces.srv.UpdateObstacles): adds obstacle to scene permanently
 - update_attached_obstacles (moveit_testing_interfaces.srv.UpdateAttachedObstacles): adds obstacle attached to robot links
 - home_waypoint (std_srvs.srv.Empty): plans to a hard coded value in the callback
 - add_walls (std_srvs.srv.Empty): adds walls and ceiling collision objects to the planning scene
 - remove_separate_lightsaber (std_srvs.srv.Empty): removes the lightsaber as collision object
 - add_separate_lightsaber (std_srvs.srv.Empty): add lightsaber as a separate collision object
 - remove_attached_lightsaber (std_srvs.srv.Empty): remove the lightsaber attached to the end-effector in the planning scene in rviz
 - add_attached_lightsaber (std_srvs.srv.Empty): add the lightsaber attached to the end-effector to the planning scene as an attached collision object.
 - look_for_enemy (std_srvs.srv.Empty): check for any enemies detected in the planning scene and begins to calculate how to attack if possible
 - reset_allies (std_srvs.srv.Empty): updates the position of the allies in the planning scene to current
